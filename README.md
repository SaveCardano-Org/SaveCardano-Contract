Save Cardano is a smart contract and NFT token that gives automatic bonuses in ADA for buying and holding the SADA. We are following the rich tradition of the Cardano platform for changemakers, innovators, and visionaries. After Cardano completed its Alonzo hard fork to introduce Plutus-powered smart contract scripts, we are building on that for our own NFT platform and smart contracts.
